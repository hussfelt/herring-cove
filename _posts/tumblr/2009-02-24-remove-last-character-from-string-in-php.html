<p>After looking around for a way to actually remove the last character of my string even if it was not the last one in the string given, I came up with these two ways. I figure that the one using <a href="http://se2.php.net/strrev" target="_blank">strrev()</a> is a lot faster then the one using <a href="http://se2.php.net/explode" target="_blank">explode()</a>, but as someone might want the first way, I publish it anyway.</p>
<p>This was the way I had done to remove the last character of any given string:</p>
<blockquote>$str = substr($str,0,strlen($str)-1);</blockquote>
<p>This was the second thing I tried (SLOWER)</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>$string = "adml,madadsdsadsadasdsa,    asd";
$string = explode(",", $string);
array_pop($string);
$string = implode(",", $string);
// Will output: adml,madadsdsadsadasdsa
echo $string;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably one of the better way of doing it! (FASTER)</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>$string = "adml,madadsdsadsadasdsa,    asd";
$string = strrev($string);
$string substr($string,strpos($string,",")+1);
// Will output: adml,madadsdsadsadasdsa
echo strrev($string);
</pre>
</blockquote>
