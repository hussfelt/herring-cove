<p>Have you ever wondered how these nice spinning graphics are created?</p>
<p>You know, the ones which often appears when you are waiting for an ajax request to finish&#8230;</p>
<p>No need to wonder anymore, ofcourse they all come from <a href="http://www.ajaxload.info/" target="_blank">Ajaxload&#8230;</a></p>
<p>&#8230;not really, butnow there is no need in spending time to manufacture one yourself anymore! :-)</p>
