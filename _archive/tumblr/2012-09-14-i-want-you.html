<p><br/>Read a blogpost <a href="http://blog.mkrecny.com/entry/23/">regarding emails sent to developers</a> about &#8220;The next thing/app/service&#8221;.</p>
<p>Found myself thinking: &#8220;I wonder how many emails like this I have responded to&#8221;, coming up with a number far greater than 100&#8230;</p>
<p>Then I thought of all the meetings I have been to before I learned to say:</p>
<p><strong>No thank you.</strong></p>
<p>I am always glad to help, and I will always try my best to guide people if I can. But a good advice is to learn to say no. It took me quite a while and a number of failures&#8230;</p>
