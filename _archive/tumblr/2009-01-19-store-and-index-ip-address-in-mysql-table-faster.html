<p>Normally one would store an IP Address in something like a VARCHAR(15). But when you have a table with a large amount of data and you need to index this field there are a better and faster option!</p>
<p>As many other nice built in things in MySQL there are two functions, INET_ATON() and INET_NTOA(). These two functions are based on the two functions with the same names that are in any tcp capable systems C library.</p>
<p>INET_ATON() will convert an IP Address to an unsigned 32-bit integer, and INET_NTOA() does the opposite thing.</p>
<p>Example;</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>mysql&gt; SELECT INET_ATON('192.168.0.10') AS ipn;
+------------+
| ipn |
+------------+
| 3232235530 |
+------------+

mysql&gt; SELECT INET_NTOA(3232235530) AS ipa;
+--------------+
| ipa |
+--------------+
| 192.168.0.10 |
+--------------+
</pre>
