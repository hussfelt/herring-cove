<p>Today we released a minor upgrade to the Categories module.</p>
<p>You now have the option to add the text &#8220;Article&#8221; or &#8220;Articles&#8221; (text depending if article count is larger then 1) after the article counter.</p>
<p>Also a minor bug was fixed where articles with state 0 was included in the counter.</p>
