<p>A thing that always bothers me, is finding a text string in a bunch of files. I have tried more than ten different ways of doing just that, but I never remember how&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;until i googled this way;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>grep -lir &#8220;some text&#8221; *</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks Carlo!</p>
