<h5 class="uiStreamMessage userContentWrapper" data-ft='{"type":1,"tn":"K"}'><span class="messageBody" data-ft='{"type":3}'>Sometimes you feel down, because you do. Sometimes you feel down because you let yourself down. Sometimes you feel down because you let others down.<br/><br/>The first one is easy, you just tell yourself to get a grip. The second one, you realize that you need to change. The last one is hard, first you need to change and then you need to let others know you have changed.<br/><br/>This is why I am aiming for never letting anyone down. Sometimes I fail.<br/></span></h5>
